Problem Statement

Students often struggle to find consistent study partners, stay motivated, and access organized learning resources. Existing tools are scattered, forcing learners to switch between multiple apps for notes, communication, scheduling, motivation, and group coordination. This app unifies all these functions in one place.

Idea Description: STUDEE

The STUDEE App is a collaborative learning platform that helps students discover or create study groups, join private rooms, access flashcards, take quizzes, schedule study sessions, and communicate through chat or audio/video calls. It integrates roadmaps, productivity tools, streaks, and note-taking features to enhance learning and accountability.
